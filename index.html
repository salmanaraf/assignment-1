            “Banker to the Poor”
            Professor Muhammad Yunus established the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in 1983, fueled by the belief that
            credit is a fundamental human right. His objective was to help poor people escape from poverty by providing
            loans on terms suitable to them and by teaching them a few sound financial principles so they could help
            themselves.”
